If you want to test the design out, use GitHub's download repo feature to download it as a zip, extract the contents of the zip into one folder, and just open up any of the .html files! Ideally, start with index.html, but all the files should have traces to every other file. 
If you use uBlockOrigin, the design will break as uBO is active on files too, so you will need to either temporarily turn it off or manually turn it off on every page.

No particular highlight - it's just a website. I primarily wanted to see how iframes would play into designing a website but soon realized it would be more trouble than I want, so I moved on
